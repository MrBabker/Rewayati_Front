        story: `The Clockmaker’s Secret

In a quiet town tucked between misty hills, there was a tiny clock shop called “Timely Whispers.”
Its owner, Mr. Elric, was an old man with silver hair, trembling hands, and eyes that ticked like gears.

Every morning, he would open his shop at exactly 7:03 a.m., wind all the clocks, and whisper to each one:

“Keep the world in motion, my friends.”

The townspeople thought he was simply eccentric—until one stormy night, all the clocks in town stopped.
Every. Single. One.

The rain froze midair. Horses halted mid-step. Even the thunder became silent.
Only Elric’s shop remained alive, filled with the faint sound of ticking.

Inside, he stood before a massive golden clock that no one had ever seen before.
Its hands pointed not to numbers—but to moments:
“Birth,” “Love,” “Loss,” “Choice,” “End.”

He sighed, turned the key, and whispered,

“Just a few more minutes, then.”

When the clocks started again, morning came too early, and the townspeople swore they’d seen a strange light fade over the hills.
The shop was empty, and Mr. Elric was gone.

Only one clock remained, softly ticking — its hands forever frozen between “Love” and “End.”`,
